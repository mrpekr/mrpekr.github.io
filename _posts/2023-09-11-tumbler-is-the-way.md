Hello im ditching this blog! and im gonna explain why

I want to be able to quickly post and even have images on a site easily accesible to everyone
I kinda am able to that here but the jank of running a jekyll site is obvious

1. this is running on a github.io domain so im kinda limiting my self to github related shit
2. The whole site is open source which is shit
3. Massive jank of even adding a single post

for all those reasons i had chose to move my blog to tumbler link: https://comrade-medic.tumblr.com
For the first couple days ill be figuring stuff out and talking about pixel art as ive recently been pationet about that.

Well see you there! This blog will remain up for idk how long but once day i will prob private the repo and the site will go down.

* Your Comrade Medic/Mr. Pekr/Chloe
